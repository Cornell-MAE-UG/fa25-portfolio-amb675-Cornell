The final project for MAE 3230, FLuid Mechanics, was to take apart a fluid mechanical system and create a 5 minute long dissection video explaining it's fluid mechanical functions. 

We got an Instapot Air Fryer Lid!!!!!!

My contribution to this project is that I found all of the formulas and plugged in most of the equations that mathematically explained the system. I also worked with Apurva and Autumn to determine the Qualitative way our system worked!
